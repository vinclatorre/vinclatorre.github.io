        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Chess is a strategy game born in India in the sixth century, in fact it's one of the oldest games in the world.</p>
        <p>
          It is played on a square board called a chessboard made up of 64 houses of alternating colors (black and white), marked horizontally with
          the numbers 1 to 8 and vertically with the letters A to H. like a Cartesian diagram.
        </p>
        <p>Then there are two armies with 16 pieces each, usually whites and blacks.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="rules" class="main-section">
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, doing one move each, white always starts first.</p>
        <p>Armies consist of a king, a queen, two knights, two bishoops, two tower and eight pawns.</p>
        <p>
          Pieces can't move in houses where there is an allied piece, but they can move in houses where there are enemy piece making a capture so
          deleting it from the chessboard. It is said that a piece attacks a square if it can move on it. When the king is in an attacked house it's
          check, when it's check and every houses where the king can move are attacked it's check mate.
        </p>
        <p>Each piece moves differently, these are all movements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>King: can move in every directions one square at time.</li>
          <li>Queen: can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
          <li>Rook: can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
          <li>
            Knight: can moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal (like an "L").The knight is the only
            piece that can leap over other pieces.
          </li>
          <li>Bishops: can move any number of squares along a diagonal but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
          <li>
            Pawn: can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same
            file, a pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="special_move" class="main-section">
        <h2>Special Move</h2>
        <p>There are three special move:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Castle: Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the player's first rank toward a rook on the same rank, and then placing
            the rook on the last square that the king crossed. It is possible only if king and the rook have never been moved, there aren't pieces
            between king and rool and the king is not in check, and will not pass through or land on any square attacked by an enemy piece.
          </li>
          <li>
            En passant: When a pawn makes a two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on a square next to the
            destination square on an adjacent file, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant, moving to the square the pawn passed over.
            This can be done only on the turn immediately following the enemy pawn's two-square advance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Promotion: When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop,
            or knight of the same color.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="opening" class="main-section">
        <h2>Opening</h2>
        <p>
          The match start with the opening, in this fase the two player fight to control the center of the board, put the king to safety(usually with
          castle) and develop pieces in strategic houses.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a lot of different combination in the opening each of them has a name. These are some of the most popular opening with their
          respective moves.

        <h2>Middle Game</h2>
        <p>
          Once the development of the pieces is finished, start the middle game, in this fase players fight to get an advantage taking advantage of
          the opponent's weak points and exploiting their own strengths to win the match.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="end_game" class="main-section">
        <h2>End Game</h2>
        <p>After the middle game when there are fewer pieces on the board start the end game. The strategic foundamental of the end game are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>King activation: since there aren't many pieces on the board , king begin a strong piece that must be moved towards the center.</li>
          <li>Pedoni: since the chessboard is empty it's very easy to promote one of them so they are very strong if moved in the right way.</li>
          <li>Zugzwang: it is a delicate position where moving is disadvantageous, then you try to make the opponent move to make him lose</li>
